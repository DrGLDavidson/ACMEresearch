# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-users" %}Team

Our group is inclusive of all races, religions, genders and sexualities. We aim to apply practical solutions to achieve a diverse, accessible and inclusive environment across academia, and we are open to learn more about the difficulties of under-represented groups.    

**WE ARE HIRING SOON**  
Check back as we will be advertising for a post-doctoral researcher, a field technician and a lab technician for an upcoming NERC Pushing the Frontiers grant, due to start February 2026.
