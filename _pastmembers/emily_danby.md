Emily Danby completed her phd in avian cognition at the University of Cambridge (primary supervisor Prof Nicola Clayton), having previously been in neuroscience research and science publication. Recent experiments have been in parental call recognition in wild Great tits, and kin recognition in Eurasian jays. Emily is interested in perception, sociality, how behaviour differs in captive vs. wild environments and also in how cognition may be affected by circadian rhythms.
