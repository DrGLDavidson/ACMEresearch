 Our projects span the field, lab and the cloud. We combine fieldwork, lab-based techniques, and advanced analytics to tackle big questions exploring the evolutionary ecology of the gut microbiome and animal cognition. Specifically, we use autonomous data collection, molecular and microbiological methods, next-generation sequencing, and cutting-edge tools in bioinformatics, machine learning, and statistical modelling.
