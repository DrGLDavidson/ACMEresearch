 Our projects span from the field to the lab to the cloud. Dive into our past, present, and emerging projects exploring the evolutionary ecology of the gut microbiome and animal cognition. We combine fieldwork, lab-based techniques, and advanced analytics to tackle big questionsâ€”using autonomous data collection, molecular and microbiological methods, next-generation sequencing, and cutting-edge tools in bioinformatics, machine learning, and statistical modelling.
