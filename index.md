From microbes to minds, our research bridges the hidden ecosystems of gut microbiomes with the complexities of animal intelligence.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Animals show striking variation in behaviour and cognitionâ€”within individuals, between individuals, and across species. These traits shape how animals interact with their environment and respond to human-driven change. Emerging evidence reveals the gut microbiome as a powerful player in driving this variation. We investigate how individual variation in learning, risk-taking, and behavioural flexibility contributes to ecological success, and under what conditions the gut microbiome mediates phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental change.
