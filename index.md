# FROM MICROBES TO MINDS

Our research bridges the hidden ecosystems of gut microbiomes with the complexities of animal intelligence in natural environments.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Animals show striking variation in behaviour and cognition, within individuals, between individuals, and across species. These traits shape how animals interact with their environment and respond to human-driven change. Emerging evidence reveals the gut microbiome as a powerful player in driving this variation. We investigate how individual variation in learning, risk-taking, and behavioural flexibility contributes to ecological success, and under what conditions the gut microbiome mediates phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental change.

 Our projects span the field, lab and the cloud. We combine fieldwork, lab-based techniques, and advanced analytics to tackle big questions exploring the evolutionary ecology of the gut microbiome and animal cognition. Specifically, we use autonomous data collection, molecular and microbiological methods, next-generation sequencing, and cutting-edge tools in bioinformatics, machine learning, and statistical modelling.
