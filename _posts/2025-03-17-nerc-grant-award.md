<!-- excerpt start -->I'm excited to announce that I've been awarded a NERC Pushing the Frontiers of Environmental Research grant, titled "**Acquisition of bene cial gut microbes and functional trade-offs in wild avian hosts**", due to begin February 2026. We'll be hiring soon. <!-- excerpt end -->

I will be leading the project working with Prof Lindsay Hall from the Quadram Institute. This project will pinpoint which microbes drive host fitness, uncover how they shape host phenotypes and resolve why gut microbiomes vary so widely in wildlife.  
  
  The NERC Pushing the Frontiers scheme funds ambitious, high-risk and high-reward projects looking at ways to help us sustain and benefit from our natural resources, predict and respond to natural hazards and understand environmental change.  

  We will be hiring to fill three positions later this year, please keep an eye out for announcements here and the University of East Anglia job opportunities website.
