Attention Bird Ringers in Norfolk and Cambridgeshire! Your Expertise Needed for Scientific Research

Dear Fellow Bird Ringers,

Greetings from the Davidson Lab, University of East Anglia (UEA). Weare reaching out to request your help and expertise collecting faecal samples from GRETI. Our current project explores the gut microbiome and its potential links to cognitive behaviour in birds across urban gradients, to enhance our understanding of urban wildlife adaptation.

Can you collect faecal samples for us during your ringing sessions in urban/non-urban habitats, including your own garden? We are collecting samples from GRETI nestlings and adults in the spring, and adults in the winter, covering Cambridgeshire and Norfolk.
