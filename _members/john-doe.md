I'm a second year PhD student, funded by an ARIES DTP. My Phd investigates the influence of gut microbiome variation on behaviour and cognition in great tits. Particularly, my research aims to explore these dynamics in urban settings, where wild animals face unique challenges and opportunities, making the study of their gut microbiomes crucial for understanding their adaptive responses.

I was awarded the **Highly Commended Early Career Researcher Poster** at the British Ornithologist's Union 2024 Conference.
