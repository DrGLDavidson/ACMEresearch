I am a second year PhD student at the University of East Anglia, exploring the dynamic and intricate world of natural soundscapes. My research, “From landscape to soundscape: what drives spatial variation in natural soundscape characteristics?” investigates how landscape structure, land-use, and avian community composition shape the acoustic character of environments.

As part of this work, I lead the UEA / British Trust for Ornithology Soundscape Monitoring Project, conducting continuous 24/7 acoustic monitoring across 70 sites in the UK since 2023. Through large-scale reconstruction and detailed acoustic analysis, I aim to reveal the ecological and environmental drivers behind spatial and temporal patterns in natural soundscapes.
